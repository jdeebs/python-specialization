Assume that you've run the following statements:

>>> str1 = 'hello, '
>>> str2 = 'how are you?'
>>> str3 = str1 + str2

Without using Python's shell, work out what the following statements would return:

str3[3:]
str3[-3:]
str3[2:9:3]
str3[::-2]
str3[2:8]

str3 = 'hello, how are you?'
str3[3:] = 'lo, how are you?'
str3[-3:] = 'ou?'
str3[2:9:3] = 'l,o'
str3[::-2] = '?o r o olh'
str3[2:8] = 'llo, h'

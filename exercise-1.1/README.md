# Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python

This directory contains the files and deliverables for Exercise 1.1 of my Python Specialization course. The goal of this exercise was to install Python, set up a virtual environment, create a simple script, and manage dependencies using `pip`.

## Tasks Completed:
1. **Python Installation**:
   - Installed Python 3.8.7 on my system and verified the installation using `python --version`.

2. **Virtual Environment Setup**:
   - Created a virtual environment named `cf-python-base` using `mkvirtualenv`.
   - Installed `ipython` in the environment and confirmed its setup by launching an IPython shell.

3. **Simple Python Script**:
   - Created a script `add.py` that asks the user to input two numbers and prints the sum of those numbers.

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Generated a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze` in the `cf-python-base` environment.
   - Created another virtual environment named `cf-python-copy` and installed the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

5. **GitHub Repo**:
   - Uploaded all exercise deliverables, including this README, the `add.py` script, the `requirements.txt` file, and screenshots of each step to a GitHub repository.

## Files in this Directory:
- `add.py`: A Python script that adds two user-provided numbers.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies for this exercise.
- Screenshots documenting the process (Step 1, Step 2, etc.).
- Learning journal documenting my experience and reflections from this exercise.

## Learning Journal:
Included in the folder is a journal of what Iâ€™ve learned in this exercise and my goals for future learning.

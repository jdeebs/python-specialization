# Exercise 1.2: Working with Data Structures in Python

This directory contains the files and deliverables for Exercise 1.2 of my Python Specialization course. The goal of this exercise was to create and manipulate data structures in Python, focusing on organizing recipe information in an efficient way.

## Tasks Completed:
1. **Recipe Structure Creation**:
   - Created a structure named `recipe_1` using a dictionary to store details for a cup of tea, including its name, cooking time, and a list of ingredients.

2. **Choosing a Data Structure**:
   - Used a **dictionary** for `recipe_1` as it allows easy access to the recipe’s attributes by key, making it intuitive to store structured data (name, cooking time, ingredients).

3. **All Recipes Structure**:
   - Created a list called `all_recipes` to store multiple recipe dictionaries, as lists are ideal for storing ordered collections where we may need to add or modify recipes later.

4. **Additional Recipes**:
   - Generated four more recipes (`recipe_2` to `recipe_5`) and added them to the `all_recipes` list.

5. **Printing Ingredients**:
   - Implemented a loop to print the ingredients of each recipe as separate lists in the IPython shell.

6. **GitHub Repo**:
   - Uploaded all exercise deliverables, including this README, screenshots of each step, and the learning journal to a GitHub repository.

## Files in this Directory:
- Screenshots documenting the process (Step 1, Step 2, etc.).
- Learning journal documenting my experience and reflections from this exercise.

## Learning Journal:
Included in the folder is a journal of what I’ve learned in this exercise and my goals for future learning.

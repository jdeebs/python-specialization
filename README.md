# Python Specialization Exercises

This repository contains the exercises I completed as part of my Python Specialization course with CareerFoundry. Each exercise is organized into its own directory, containing all relevant files for that specific exercise.

## Achievement 1: Introduction to Python

In this achievement, I learned the basics of Python programming, including:

- Data types and structures
- Operators and functions
- File handling
- Exception handling

I implemented object-oriented programming concepts to create a database for a recipe application. Throughout the process, I practiced standard Python programming practices to write simpler, more readable, and robust code.

### Exercises Overview

1. **Getting Started with Python**
   - Introduction to Python syntax and environment setup.
   
2. **Data Types in Python**
   - Understanding various data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and lists.
   
3. **Operators & Functions in Python**
   - Utilizing operators for calculations and creating functions to organize code.
   
4. **File Handling in Python**
   - Reading from and writing to files, along with handling file exceptions.
   
5. **Object-Oriented Programming in Python**
   - Implementing classes and objects, and understanding inheritance and polymorphism.
   
6. **Databases in Python**
   - Creating and managing databases using SQLite.
   
7. **Object-Relational Mapping in Python**
   - Learning how to use ORM tools to interact with databases in a more Pythonic way.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jdeebs/python-specialization.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the exercise directory you wish to explore:
   ```bash
   cd exercise-1.1
   ```

3. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the main file:
   ```bash
   python add.py
   ```

## Achievement 2: Web Development & Django

In this achievement, I will rebuild the Recipe app from Achievement 1 using the Django web framework, transforming it into a dynamic, multi-user web application. This project focuses on creating a full-stack web application with user authentication, an admin panel, and interactive features for managing and visualizing recipe data.

### Exercises Overview

1. **Getting Started with Django**  
   - Set up a virtual environment and install Django on various platforms.  

2. **Django Project Setup**  
   - Create the Django project and apps, and explored settings and the admin panel.  

3. **Django Models**  
   - Design models for recipes and ingredients and register them in the admin panel.  
   - Add database records and write automated tests.

4. **Django Views and Templates**  
   - Define views and render dynamic web pages.  
   - Develop URLs and routes for smooth navigation.

5. **Django MVT Revisited**  
   - Update recipe data and develop pages for recipe information.  
   - Create a welcoming interface.

6. **User Authentication**  
   - Implement login, logout, and access protection features.

7. **Data Analysis and Visualization**  
   - Add search functionality and data analytics dashboards.

8. **Deploying a Django Project**  
   - Package and deploy the application to Heroku, ensuring it is production-ready.

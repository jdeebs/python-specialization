# Python Specialization Exercises

This repository contains the exercises I completed as part of my Python Specialization course with CareerFoundry. Each exercise is organized into its own directory, containing all relevant files for that specific exercise.

## Achievement 1: Introduction to Python

In this achievement, I will learn the basics of Python programming, including:

- Data types and structures
- Operators and functions
- File handling
- Exception handling

I will implement object-oriented programming concepts to create a database for a recipe application. Throughout the process, I will practice standard Python programming practices to write simpler, more readable, and robust code.

### Exercises Overview

1. **Getting Started with Python**
   - Introduction to Python syntax and environment setup.
   
2. **Data Types in Python**
   - Understanding various data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and lists.
   
3. **Operators & Functions in Python**
   - Utilizing operators for calculations and creating functions to organize code.
   
4. **File Handling in Python**
   - Reading from and writing to files, along with handling file exceptions.
   
5. **Object-Oriented Programming in Python**
   - Implementing classes and objects, and understanding inheritance and polymorphism.
   
6. **Databases in Python**
   - Creating and managing databases using SQLite.
   
7. **Object-Relational Mapping in Python**
   - Learning how to use ORM tools to interact with databases in a more Pythonic way.
